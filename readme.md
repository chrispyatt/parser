This repo contains the programming assignment for Chris Pyatt and Simon Lam.

The repo contains 5 files. The main program is parser.py. There are also two test CSVs for testing without internet connection, this README, and a Jupyter notebook that runs the stats analysis separately.

Parser.py 

Run a test with:

  python parser.py --test
  
or

  python parser.py --testOffline
  

Otherwise, supply an input dataset using the [-i] option, a column variable to plot on the x axis with [-x], another for the y axis with [-y], and one by which to group the data (e.g. by practice) with [-g].

Use the [-h] option for more info.
